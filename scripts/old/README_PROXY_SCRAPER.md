# Companies House Proxy-Enabled Scraper for 122k Companies

## Overview

This is an enhanced version of the Companies House scraper that uses **Bright Data (formerly Luminati) proxy servers** to enable:
- **Parallel scraping** with 100+ concurrent requests
- **IP rotation** to avoid blocking
- **Session management** for consistent results
- **Much faster scraping** (10-50x faster than non-proxy version)

## Key Features

### With Proxy (Recommended)
- ✅ 100+ parallel requests
- ✅ Automatic IP rotation
- ✅ No blocking issues
- ✅ 50-100 companies/second
- ✅ Complete 122k in 30-60 minutes

### Without Proxy
- ⚠️ 5-10 parallel requests max
- ⚠️ Risk of IP blocking
- ⚠️ 2-3 companies/second
- ⚠️ 122k would take days

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Bright Data Account

1. Sign up at https://brightdata.com
2. Create a new proxy zone:
   - Type: **Datacenter** (recommended for speed)
   - Or **Residential** (for maximum success rate)
3. Get your credentials:
   - Username (includes zone info)
   - Password
   - Port (usually 22225)

### 2. Configure the Script

Edit `scrape_companies_house_proxy_windows.py` and update:

```python
# Line 15-17 - Update with your credentials
PROXY_USERNAME = "brd-customer-hl_997fefd5-zone-ch30oct22"
PROXY_PASSWORD = "kikhwzt80akq"
PROXY_PORT = "22225"
```

### 3. Prepare Your Data

You should already have `companies_to_scrape_122k.csv` with 122,306 companies.

### 4. Run the Scraper

```python
# In Python IDLE or command line:
python scrape_companies_house_proxy_windows.py

# Follow the prompts:
# 1. Input file: companies_to_scrape_122k.csv
# 2. Output file: [press Enter for auto-generated name]
# 3. Batch size: 100 (with proxy) or 5 (without)
```

## Performance Comparison

### With Bright Data Proxy
- **Batch Size**: 100-200
- **Speed**: 50-100 companies/second
- **122k companies**: 30-60 minutes
- **Success Rate**: 99%+
- **Cost**: ~$10-20 for datacenter proxies

### Without Proxy
- **Batch Size**: 5-10
- **Speed**: 2-3 companies/second
- **122k companies**: 11-17 hours
- **Success Rate**: Variable (blocking risk)
- **Cost**: Free but slow

## Recommended Settings

### For Maximum Speed (with proxy)
```
Batch size: 200
Proxy type: Datacenter
Expected time: 20-30 minutes for 122k
```

### For Maximum Success Rate (with proxy)
```
Batch size: 100
Proxy type: Residential
Expected time: 45-60 minutes for 122k
```

### Conservative (without proxy)
```
Batch size: 5
No proxy
Expected time: 11-17 hours for 122k
```

## Features Explained

### 1. Session Management
Each request uses a unique session ID for IP rotation:
```python
session_id = str(random.random())
proxy_url = f'http://{username}-session-{session_id}:...'
```

### 2. Caching Database
Results are cached in `companies_cache.db` to avoid re-scraping:
- Automatic deduplication
- Resume capability
- Faster re-runs

### 3. Thread Safety
- Thread locks for statistics
- Safe database operations
- Queue-based result handling

### 4. Error Handling
- Automatic retries
- Detailed error messages
- Partial results saved continuously

## Output Format

The CSV output contains:
```
Search Name,Found Name,Company Number,Company URL,Status,Error,Timestamp
15 FAWLEY LIMITED,15 FAWLEY LIMITED,07970033,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07970033,FOUND,,2025-01-18 14:23:45
```

### Status Values:
- **FOUND**: Company found with details
- **NOT_FOUND**: No matching company
- **ERROR**: Request or parsing error

## Troubleshooting

### "Proxy authentication failed"
- Check your Bright Data credentials
- Ensure your proxy zone is active
- Verify your account has credit

### "Connection timeout"
- Reduce batch size
- Check internet connection
- Verify proxy settings

### "Too many requests"
- Your proxy plan may have limits
- Reduce batch size
- Add delays between batches

## Cost Estimation

### Bright Data Pricing (approximate)
- **Datacenter proxies**: $0.50-1.00 per GB
- **Residential proxies**: $15-20 per GB
- **122k companies**: ~100-500 MB traffic

### Expected Costs
- **Datacenter**: $0.50-5.00 total
- **Residential**: $5-20 total

## Advanced Usage

### Split Processing
For even faster processing, split the 122k into multiple files:
```python
# Run 4 instances with 30k companies each
# Each on different proxy zones or ports
```

### Custom Proxy Configuration
```python
# Use specific country IPs
proxy_url = scraper.get_proxy_url(country='gb')

# Use sticky sessions
proxy_url = f'http://{username}-session-{session_id}-time-10:...'
```

### Database Integration
The scraper includes SQLite caching which can be extended to:
- Track scraping history
- Export to PostgreSQL
- Generate reports

## Tips for 122k Scrape

1. **Test First**: Run 1000 companies to verify setup
2. **Monitor Progress**: Check output file periodically
3. **Use Datacenter Proxies**: Best cost/performance ratio
4. **Run During Off-Peak**: UK nighttime may be faster
5. **Keep Batch Size Reasonable**: 100-150 is optimal
6. **Save Partial Results**: Output is saved continuously
